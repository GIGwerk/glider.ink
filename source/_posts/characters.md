Even after spending three years in a hackerspace myself I decided to do a proper research about what kinds of people visit such creative spaces around the world. After a lot of reading and visiting several Spaces across different continents I came up with more than a dozen of "archetypes" and chose those which could be best represented in a story.

All the designs and descriptions reflect the current state of my work and are a subject of change.

## Main cast
#### Suzanne - the Inventor

There's that one person who always comes to the 'Space to work on their project, hellbent on finishing it no matter what. Everyone wonders when they'll finally get tired, but they possess some kind of vision that drives them to yet another sleepless night over signal analysis or PCB schematics.

>

Suzanne is working on an EMG interface for her missing hand - NOT a prosthesis. She wants to be able to operate computers with what she has, not just to wear some cumbersome glove which would allow her to look _normal_.

Many people perceive her as a token girl or the Glider's mascot, which she openly hates. Suz wants to be able perceived for what she _does_, not how she _looks_.

#### c_n1c - the Troll

    style="max-height: 600px"
>

Professional (and ranked) CTFer and main administrator of all the Glider's infrastructure, Cynic has probably the biggest overall IT expertise in the space. He spends most of the days reconfiguring the servers or playing with some new dongles shipped from China. No one knows if he has a real job - or what's his real name.

Cynic is quite bitter when it comes to people, not believing in most of the educational effort other hackers organize. The masses won't learn anyway.

He finds some joy in exploiting that stupidity, writing elegant trolling tools and preparing pranks - or just sowing some civilian-grade chaos on the messaging boards.

#### Adam - the Activist

    style="max-height: 600px"
>

Adam loves Glider as a community and wants to keep it as varied and lively as possible. Even though his constant stream of ideas doesn't play well with everybody, he is somehow able to convince them to join a manifestation - or a hackathon - just one more time.

He's the NGO guy, helping different organizations to keep the basic security, have database backups done on time - and mingling with them at every event. When he does have some free time on his hands, Adam likes doing some journalism, using some unwisely opened data bases or web scrapes - and seeing much more than his colleagues from the press.

    style="max-height: 600px"
>

With all that social activism, Adam tends to be a little too self-focused. He is known for stealing the spotlight and claiming the project as his - even if all he did was just delivering some leads.

#### Amanda - the Anarchist

Amanda is an anarchist working between the Glider and a local squat. She's an outspoken feminist - and while Suzanne can just ask to "leave her alone", Amanda will be very vocal in criticizing every inequality.

She's a sound engineer and operator to be found both at a movie set and preparing events. Her initial love for punk rock and metal has eventually led her to value much more types of music - and even try to experiment with creating something herself. Amanda keeps a collection of old USRR synthesizers in Space and can be often found playing with them.

>

Getting close to her 30th birthday Amanda has some questions about her life to answer. She's slowly getting tired of being a "bigger sister" for a lot of other anarchists, and still doesn't see the change she had hoped for most of her life. Is this the time to change the approach?

#### Robert - the Maker

    style="max-height: 600px"
>

One of the original Glider founders and a well known figure in the local Maker movement, Robert is also a family man. He loves taking his kids - Cleo and Mike - to the Space and teaching them how to build a robot or to fix a bicycle.

While the least-present of the "core crew", Robert is also the most responsible of them. This often leads to conflicts, when he trusts Adam or Cynic to get something done - and it gets forgotten somewhere along the way.

He's pretty adamant at keeping the Glider free of politics - it should be a shared workshop, a place to run classes from, not any kind of lobbyist institution.

## Secondary Characters
#### Felix - the Networker

>

In a fantasy novel, there's that Innkeeper that always knows everybody and gives characters quests. In a hackerspace, there's that guy who knows everybody, is able to get invitation to every event and would gladly find you a contact to anyone you're looking for.

Felix tends to work in hipster cafes and craft bars, co-organizing nearly every tech event in the city. He really likes the Glider and supports it with a permanent discount for all the members. That's usually enough for everybody to forget his unsavory obsession with apples.
